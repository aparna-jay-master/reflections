When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Collaboration would be much easier if it's remote rather than being local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might not want every change/update made public for whatever reason.  You may only
	want to push things that are in a cleaner version.
