How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Assuming the bug was working before, you know that something you changed must
    have caused it to stop working.  So by finding exactly what you changed, you 
    can narrow your search.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    History repeats itself, unless you have a good record of it.  The it still
    might repeat itself :P

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have to remember to commit each change but you can ensure each commit is
    meaningful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    These files work together so it makes sense to track their changes as a group.
    If soemthing stops working in one file it can affect the ability for the other
    files to function properly.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use log to get an overview of all the changes that were made and use 
    diff to see exactly what changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I have the history of the file so I can go back if I REALLY break something
    or is makes it easier to find where I made a mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    No idea but this is taking up time so whatever.
