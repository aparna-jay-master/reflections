What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a hidden folder that stores the repository of changes.  We need
	to tell Git that we want to track these changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is where git knows we are working on these files.  It can
	allow us to tell git to watch these files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You can see what changes are all going to be recorded in the staging area
	and see that they make sense for one commit.
