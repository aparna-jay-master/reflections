When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Collaboration would be much easier if it's remote rather than being local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might not want every change/update made public for whatever reason.  You may only
	want to push things that are in a cleaner version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are a copy of someone's GitHub repo.
	Clones are copies of a GitHub repo on your local machine.
	Branches are versions of your repo that differ from the Master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I'm not sure.  This part I do not understand.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Yes it would.
